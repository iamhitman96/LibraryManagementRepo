                                  It flourished under the patronage of the Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship 
                                  from its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of Egypt in 30 BC.
                                   The library was conceived and opened either during the reign of Ptolemy I Soter (323–283 BC) or during the reign of his son
                                    Ptolemy II (283–246 BC).
                                  An early organization system was in effect at Alexandria.</p>

                                      Turkey was built in honor of the Roman Senator Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus
                                       (completed in 135) by Celsus’ son, Gaius Julius Aquila (consul, 110 AD). 
                                      The library was built to store 12,000 scrolls and to serve as a monumental tomb for Celsus.</p></div>
